Hello there
This is a collection of files for Magic Foundations shenanigans
In the folders you'll find a bunch of text files containing different (mostly unsorted) cards from Magic: The Gathering Foundations
The Cards directory contains a lot of lists for different combinations of different card packs
For example [FDN_no_bb_no_starter](https://github.com/heriklesDM/MagicFoundations/blob/main/Cards/FDN_no_bb_no_starter) contains all Foundation Cards not found in the beginner box and starter collection.

The [simulation results](https://github.com/heriklesDM/MagicFoundations/blob/main/simulation_results.json) contain a simulation of 10000 different card draws until all unique cards have been found.
The results have been generated using the BoosterSim.py script.

The two images here are plots of the average and median amount of booster packs to open to collect various amounts of card types.
These have been generated with the visualize_sim.py script.

All of these simulations might be statistical anomalies and my math may be wrong so take all of this with a grain of salt :)
